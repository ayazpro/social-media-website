# social-media-website
The goal of this project is to make a social media website with html, css and vanilla javaScript, no frameworks or libraries requeried.

## functionalites to develop:
    # A fully responsive website with multiple pages
      the website must have multiple pages like homepage, login, register and a page to visualize videos
     
    # hability to create posts
      let's think of this like the create posts funcionality of twitter, where you type some text and u can post it
      (the posts must have the date they were uploaded).
      
      You could go wild if you want to, but thats all is necessary for this case.
      
    # client side form validation
      since you wont be using any tool for the backend, the only thing that you gotta do is to validate the data and
      allow the user to continue to the other page.
      
    # toggle menu
      it will also be necessary to create a menu that you can open and close when u click a button, it is a common
      practice to create hamburguer buttons to open and close the menu.
      
    # play videos
      for this functionality you can use the youtube api to create a video player ( this should be one of the lasts 
      things to do).
      
any suggestions or questions are welcome üòÅ
